    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div>
        
    </div>
    <p>I have worked in a completely different field of work before,
       but in the last few years I have realized that I am interested
       in information technology because this industry is constantly
       evolving and also provides opportunities for personal growth.
       I want to work job that provides intellectual satisfaction,
       gives the opportunity to cooperate with positive colleagues
       and provide a lasting investment in the IT industry.
    </p>
    <h2>EDUCATION</h2>
    <p>I started my IT studies in 2020 with IT technical support studying.
       Within the framework of this training course, I learned also
        the basics of programming (C++), and realized that programming
       is what I like the most of all it - it is an opportunity to
       create something new by myself. That's why in 2021 I started
       in to learn programming in the adult education program offered
       by Ventspils University in the Python programming course.
       Now, in 2023, I finished web developing course with
       learning abot HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In free time
       I studied by myself for better understanding about
       cloud computing, code hosting platforms and
       administrative IT tools.</p>
    <h2>COMMUNICATION</h2>
    <p>Well..yes, English definately is not my native language.
       I better understand it than speak. But I'm fast learner!
       So I believe, that with evereyday practice at work
       I will be able to communicate in it fluently soon enough
       I used to work in team and easily get
       along with other people.</p>
    <p>Currently, I have little programming experience and lack of
       practice in English, but these things are easy to fix with
       the work experience I want to gain. I like challenges,
       I want to learn and I'm quick learner. I am interested in
       personal growth that would benefit both myself and company
       I work for.</p>
